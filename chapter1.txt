Git users can broadly be grouped into four categories for the purposes of describing
here a small set of useful command for everyday Git.

>>Individual Developer (Standalone): commands are essential for anybody who makes a commit,
 even for somebody who works alone.

>>If you work with other people, you will need commands listed in the Individual Developer
 (Participant) section as well.

>>People who play the Integrator role need to learn some more commands in addition to the above.

>>Repository Administration commands are for system administrators who are responsible for 
the care and feeding of Git repositories.


Individual Developer (Standalone):
A standalone individual developer does not exchange patches with other people,
and works alone in a single repository, using the following commands.

> git init: to create or initialize a new repository.

> git add: this is used to add file to the local repo in other to begin to track the file,
just type 'git add' plus the file name and extention the hit enter. eg; git add chapter1.txt.
note; using "git add ." adds everything in your current directory.

> git status: this is to see whats inside your staging area.

> git diff: this is similar to git status but abit different, this command logs the difference
between the last commits on the terminal.

> git commit: this is used to commit a file under version control, the "-m" flag is used
to add a commit message. eg; git commit -m " this is the first part".

> git log: this is used to see the commit you have made or what happened.

> git checkout: this is used to revert to the last committed version of a file.

> rm .git/index.lock ; this is used to remove error.

> to push on github: "git remote add origin" and then the repo address then hit enter. eg;
	git remote add origin https://github.com/dollasun/Git-Commands.git

>to push to remote repository: "git push -u origin master"
